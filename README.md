# SalesApp
Hockley Mint has implemented a Sales Management System. While testing the System, the team realised some data was incomplete or missing. You are tasked with proposing a function using C# to retrieve the records from the SQL server and replace all the records in the 'Territory' field with missing data with the salesperson's name. You are encouraged to use object-oriented principles and good coding practices in your solution. Provide comments and explanations for your code to demonstrate your understanding.
SQL Server Name: SalesTest@127.0.0.1
Username: DevTest
Password: D3velop
Database name: SalesSys 
Fields:
•	AccountNo
•	Account_Customer
•	Territory
•	Product	Display Code
•	Product Group
•	Quantity
•	Line Value
•	Sales_Person
The C# function should:
•	retrieve the data from the SQL Server, 
•	allow the user to filter blank records,
•	replace the empty records with the salesperson's name and
•	update the server.
